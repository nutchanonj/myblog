My name is Nutchanon Jariyanurut. I'm from Chonburi, Thailand. The city where I live is Bang Saen. It's kinda like a travelers' attraction with the very beautiful beach. (I recommend you to go there in winter; the sea water is very dirty during monsoon season.) You can see how Bang Saen is [here](https://web.facebook.com/shopjungbangsaen/).

Currently I'm studying in [Dept. of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.eng.chula.ac.th/), at [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/). I'm in the fourth year now. My interests are electronics (especially digital and analog design) control systems, and anything related to maths in general (including AI, ML and data analytics.)
